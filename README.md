# Rigid Body Solutions

Manually solving the problems in Chapter 4 can be tedious and error-prone, moreover it takes too damn long (especially when you're solving all of them). To get around this I wrote some code; it was much more fun to write the code than to punch all that in the calculator, also having the programmatic output allowed me to use it as a teleprompter. 

## Using this code

This was written in Python2 (2.7.3 probably), and it uses (numpy)[http://www.numpy.org/] to do the mathematical heavy lifting. So you will need to install it before using this code.

There are two libraries included with this code `rigidbodies.py` and `mdof.py`. These allow for calculations about rigid body motion and multiple degree of freedom motion respectively. I originally chose to not release these only because it would be really easy to *cheat* and to try to pass of my code as your code on assignments and projects. Please don't do this. Use my code to check your work and to learn how to leverage software to make your life easier.

The files of the form  `p#_##.py` are all solutions to the problem implied by the numbers. These problem numbers are in reference to the 10th edition of the textbook.

Enjoy, and pay it forward!
